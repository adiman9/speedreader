# Speed Reader

I saw an interesting app online that allowed users to run a javascript applet on any page with text on it. That applet would then take all the text from that page and run it through a little viewer at a given words per minute speed, thus allowing you to read at a pace quicker than your eyes would typically move across the words while reading normally. 

I liked this idea and this repo is my (very crude) version of that idea. 

##How it works?

By simply copying the text you want to read and setting the WPM reading speed then clicking "go" the app will run the words throught the viewer at that speed, allowing you to read much faster than normal.

The logic is all javascript based and the aesthetics is simple crudely thrown together html markup.
